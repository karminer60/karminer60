### Hi👋

- 🔭 I'll be starting as a Software Engineer II at Github soon, and I am also about to start a part-time online conversion master's in computer science at the University of Liverpool :). I am also working on a Pressure Cooker Recipe website and a Song Lyrics Search application.
- 🌱 I learned Java, JavaScript, React, Redux, and HTML + CSS @ Lambda School, and I learned Ruby on Rails through an internship at sweetgreen and a job at SixFifty. I am taking computer science classes at CCSF.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that positively impact the world. I am particularly interested in contributing to projects that help women who experience domestic abuse.
