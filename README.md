### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m a Junior Software Engineer and I am working on: a Pressure Cooker Recipe website and a Song Lyrics Search application.
- 🌱 I learned Java, JavaScript, React, Redux, and HTML/CSS @Lambda School and I learned Ruby on Rails through an internship at sweetgreen and a job at Sixfifty. I am currently learning about automation testing.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make a positive impact in the world. I am particularly interested in contributing to projects that help women who experience domestic abuse.
