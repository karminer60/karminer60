### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Junior Software Engineer and I am working on: a Pressure Cooker Recipe website and a Song Lyrics Search application. I am also about to start a part-time online conversion master's in computer science at the University of Liverpool!
- ðŸŒ± I learned Java, JavaScript, React, Redux, and HTML + CSS @Lambda School and I learned Ruby on Rails through an internship at sweetgreen and a job at Sixfifty. I am currently learning about automation testing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that make a positive impact in the world. I am particularly interested in contributing to projects that help women who experience domestic abuse.
